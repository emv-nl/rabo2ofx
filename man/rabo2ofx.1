.SH NAME
rabo2ofx.py - Convert Dutch Rabo csv files to ofx for GnuCash
.SH SYNOPSIS
rabo2ofx.py FILENAME
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program converts Dutch .csv files from the Rabo bank to OFX files 
for GnuCash. 
.SS Config

The program uses a config file that contains the account numbers 
with most important accounts first. An example config should have been
copied into your distribution. If not, the layout is simple:
.nf

[account]
account1 = nl89rabo999999
account2 = nl71rabo888888
.PP
Be careful to put the config in the directory from which you execute the program.
In future I might change this to being a hidden file in the home directory.
.SS Config processing
The config is important for processing transfers between accounts you 
control. If you don't enter the accounts in the config, then you might
end up with duplicate transactions (one from each account). Should both transactions
be in the same file, only the first account encountered will be processed, the transfers
from the second to the first will be ignored. If the accounts are in different
files, transfers will occur in both ofx files and thus might end up as
duplicates in your GnuCash administration.

.SH BUGS
Rabo misuses a data field called 'datum' (=date) to place the Rabo processing 
date for consumers and the booking date for professional customers. Due to
this unfortunate choice, the program uses the interestdate to determine the 
bookingdate.
.PP
Should the Rabo ever change its policy to include both booking date and 
processingdate, I will change the program to use the booking date.
